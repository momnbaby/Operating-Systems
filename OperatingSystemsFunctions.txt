A file manager is an Operating system function that stores your files on your computer. It holds on your program files as well as any personal documents including picutres. It is this system function that makes sure that your computer can find a file, and that it remains in the correct folder or location, if it did not do this dyou would get a corrupt ile location error. 
A Device manager is used to manage the connectivity and usage of all external devices. For example if you connect an eternal mouse on a laptop, its the job of the device manager to recognize this, and store the needed functions to keep it running. Without the device management function you would have to program your external devices on your own. This also will help with troubleshooting your device connectivity as well.
